toy to mess around with flow fields on the gpu  
this code is some of my earlier work and its really messy, but i think its a fun showcase of flowfields so i'm keeping it here  

## run
run with ```cargo +nightly run --release```

## controls
```wasd``` to move  
```shift``` to move faster  
```control``` to move slower  
```scroll``` to zoom  
```space``` to pause  
```f11``` or ```alt + enter``` to fullscreen   
```escape``` to close
